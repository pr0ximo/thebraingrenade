## Introduction
Garage door openers are great aren't they.  This garage door opener
is for a single car garage.  It is a simple design that uses a RaspberryPi4
to control a relay that is connected to the garage door opener.  The
RaspberryPi4 is connected to the internet via WiFi.  The garage door
opener is controlled via a web page that is hosted in AWS Ec2. Optionally
you could also do a serverless design, but I wanted to use some spare Ec2 credits
that I had laying around. The web page is written in React, and can be hosted in either
s3 or Ec2.  

## Hardware
The hardware is pretty simple.  You need:

1. RaspberryPi4
2. Relay
4. 12V power supply

## Software
For my backend I used AWS Ec2.  I used a t3.micro instance.  I used a Golang web server to
communicate with AWS IoT MQQT broker, and AWS IoT was used to communicate with the RaspberryPi4.
